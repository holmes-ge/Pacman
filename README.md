# Pacman
This is an exercise that creates Pacman icons with the click of a button and moves them about the browser window each at their own pace. 
Upon clicking "Add Pacman" in the web page, Javascript functions create a Pacman at a random location with a random velocity. 
When "Start Game" is clicked, the Pacmen move around in the DOM and change positions when they detect a collision with a wall. 
You can generate as many Pacmen as you want, and they will all move about your screen individually.
