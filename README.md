# Pacman
This is an exercise that creates Pacman icons with the click of a button and moves them about the browser window each at their own pace. 
Upon clicking the "Add Pacman" button in the web page, Javascript functions create a Pacman at a random location with a random velocity. 
When "Start Game" is clicked, the Pacman will move around in the DOM and change positions when it detects a collision with a wall. 
You can generate as many Pacmen as you want, and they will all move about your screen individually. 

Next in this repository, I plan to program the Pacman image to change the direction it is facing once it bounces off a wall. Additionally, I want to program the Pacmen to change color each time they hit the wall. Eventually I would like to make the Pacman user controllable with a function that displays snacks on random areas of the screen to eat within a certain timeframe.
